Hi there, I'm Tawanda 👋

I build software - mostly web applications and dev tools, increasingly games.

 I have a CS degree and just over 3 years building production web-based systems. I work primarily with PHP, Go, Java, and Python depending on the scale of the project and domain. I've also recently developed an interest in game development and have been learning C# with that in mind.

Professionally, I've built Shopify apps, mobile applications, and led architecture migrations. For the past several months, I've been the primary developer on Zapiet Eats, managing everything from feature development to deployment strategy.

Personally, I build whatever interests me: lightweight tools, self-hosted web apps, visualizations, and lately, games.

Current focus: Exploring game development with Godot and C# and documenting what I build along the way.

I also write @ [My Blog](https://www.tawandamunongo.dev/) - technical posts, architecture thoughts, and occasional essays on building things that matter.
