Hi there, I'm Tawanda 👋

I build software - mostly web applications and dev tools, increasingly games.

Background: Computer Science degree. Three years building production web apps. I work primarily with PHP (Laravel), TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java. I explore other languages when they solve problems elegantly (Go for lightweight systems, Rust for performance-critical work), but my production focus is on OOP languages where I can move fast and maintain clarity.

Professionally, I've built Shopify apps, mobile applications, and led architecture migrations. For the past several months, I've been the primary developer on Zapiet Eats serving thousands of users, managing everything from feature development to deployment strategy.

Personally, I build whatever interests me: lightweight tools, self-hosted web apps, visualizations, and lately, games.

Current focus: Exploring game development with Godot and C# and documenting what I build along the way.

I also write @ [My Blog](https://www.tawandamunongo.dev/) - technical posts, architecture thoughts, and occasional essays on building things that matter.
