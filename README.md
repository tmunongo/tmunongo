Hi there, I'm Tawanda 👋

I'm a software engineer and writer.

Some of my most recent creations include:
- [Rivalspy](https://rivals.webbe.dev) - a Fantasy Premier League assistant tool.
- [HN Digest](https://hndigest.webbe.dev) - a tool that converts top Hackernews posts into a scheduled RSS feed.
- [Nanotools](https://tools.webbe.dev) - a collection of web-based utilities.
- [hwfst](https://github.com/tmunongo/hwfst) - a CLI-based speed test tool with a production-grade Grafana dashboard.

I also write @ [my blog](https://www.tawandamunongo.dev/) - technical posts, architecture thoughts, and occasional essays on building things that matter.
