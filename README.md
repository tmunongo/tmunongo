## Hi there, I'm Tawanda 👋

I build software.

I've worked on everything from mobile applications for government agencies, to web applications in the e-commerce and real estate spaces, and terminal-based developer tooling.

I also write @ [My Blog](https://www.tawandamunongo.dev), mostly about code, but sometimes about other things, too.
