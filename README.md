## Hi there, I'm Tawanda 👋

I build software.

I am passionate about building tooling and infrastructure software that allows impactful teams to do their work with little friction.

Over the years, I have built full-stack web applications, cross-platform mobile applications, and CLI tools with Java, PHP, TypeScript, and Go. You can find a more detailed breakdown of my work history on my [about](https://tawandamunongo.dev/about) page.

I also write @ [My Blog](https://www.tawandamunongo.dev), mostly about code, but sometimes about other things, too.

You can find all repos associated with blog posts/tutorials in [this org](https://github.com/orgs/inthesh3ll/repositories)
